description: Drift's Dart library for declaring tables and writing queries.

After writing a database [as described in the setup page](../setup.md),
drift will generate code enabling you to write SQL statements in Dart.

The pages on [select statements](select.md) and [insert, updates and deletes](writes.md)
explain how to construct statements.

Advanced features include support for transactions, complex SQL expressions and [database accessor classes](daos.md).
